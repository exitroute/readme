Hello, is that you Ryan. I'm groping my way through this thing. Is a fork the same and an effing branch? 

Thanks for opening this file and taking the time to read me. 

If you want to know more then read on! But if you are happy to leave then 
there is no need for tears as you shift your attention elsewhere.

But I will say one thing before before you go.
Readme begins here. Readme starts here. 
It commits here.

End.

## Repos and Folders

I wanted to make a repo for this readme, but I had to make a folder first.
A repo tracks the changes of all the files that aren't on it's ignore list.
But I set the limits of this repo's indexing of change to the contents of
this folder.
